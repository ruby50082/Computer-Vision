# Introduction
- The goal of this project is to build a classifier with 3 methods to categorize images into one of 15 scene types, e.g., office, kitchen.
- Task1: Find the tiny images representation and then apply nearest neighbor classifier to categorize images.
- Task2: Apply SIFT on tiny images to obtain bag of SIFT representation, then use nearest neighbor classifier to categorize images.
- Task3: Apply SIFT on tiny images to obtain bag of SIFT representation, then use linear SVM classifier to categorize images.
