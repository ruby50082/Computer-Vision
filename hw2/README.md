# Introduction

1. Hybrid Image
  - A hybrid image is the sum of a low-pass filtered version of the one image and a high-pass filtered version of a second image.

  - Image → Fourier Transformation →  Multiply by a filter function → Inverse Fourier Transform
  - Filter function: low-pass filter & high-pass filter

2. Image Pyramid
  - An image Pyramid is a collection of representations of an image.

  - Gaussian pyramid: apply the Gaussian Filter on the spatial domain and resize the image.
  - Laplacian pyramid: the level k image is generated by subtracting the resized k+1 image from level k in the Gaussian pyramid.
  - Visualization of the frequency information in each level of Gaussian pyramid and Laplacian pyramid.

3. Colorizing the Russian Empire
  - Colorizing the Russian Empire is to produce a color image from the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images with as minimal visual artifacts as possible. 
  - In order to do this, extract the three color channels from the glass plate, then place and align one above the other so that the combination forms a single RGB color image.
  - Preprocessing: crop & split the input image

  - Step1: Get the edges of image using sobel filter.
  - Step2: Image Pyramid to speed up the alignment process
  - Step3: Alignment & Combine three channels to form the RGB image.
